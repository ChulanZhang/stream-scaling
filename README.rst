Introduction
============

``stream-scaling`` automates running the STREAM memory bandwidth
test on Linux systems.  It detects the number of CPUs and
how large each of their caches are.  The program then
downloads STREAM, compiles it, and runs it with an array
size large enough to not fit into cache.  The number
of threads is varied from 1 to the total number of
cores in the server, so that you can see how memory speed
scales as cores involved increase.

Installation/Usage
==================

Just run stream-scaling::

  ./stream-scaling

And it should do the rest.  Note that a stream.c and stream
binary will be left behind afterwards.

Note that the program is only expected to work on systems
using gcc 4.2 or later, as the OpenMP libraries are required.

Sample result
=============

This sample is from an Intel i7 860 processor, featuring 4 real cores with
Hyper Threading for a total of 8 virtual cores.  It also features the Turbo feature
to accelerate running with low core counts.  Memory is 4 X 2GB DDR-1600::

Like many of the post-Nehalem Intel processors, this system gets
quite good memory bandwidth even when running a single thread,
with the Turbo feature helping a bit too.  And it's almost reached
saturation of all available bandwidth with only two threads active,
which is good for a system with this many cores; they don't all
have to be doing something to take advantage of all the memory
on this server.

Results database
================

Eventually it's hoped that this program can help build a database
of per-core scaling information for STREAM similar to the the
core STREAM project maintains for peak throughput.  Guidelines
for submission to such a project are still being worked on.
Please contact the author if you have any ideas for helping organize
this work.

* The result for 6-core processors with 6 threads is shown in the 8-core column.  Only so much space to work with here...

Todo
====

* Adding compatibility with more operating systems than Linux
  would be nice.

* A results processor that took the verbose output shown
  and instead produced a compact version for easy comparison
  with other systems, similar to the CSV output mode of
  bonnie++, would make this program more useful.

Bugs
====

There aren't any known bugs, just limitations.

Documentation
=============

The documentation README.rst for the program is in ReST markup.  Tools
that operate on ReST can be used to make versions of it formatted
for other purposes, such as rst2html to make a HTML version.
